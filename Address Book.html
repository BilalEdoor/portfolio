    <h1>ADDRESS BOOK</h1>
    <p>Description of the Address Book Project using Object Oriented Programming in Java
        Introduction:
        
        The Address Book Project is a simple application that aims to store contact information of people, such as name, phone number, email, and address. This project can be used as a basic example to understand the concepts of object-oriented programming in Java, such as:
        
        Classes: To represent real objects such as "person".
        
        Objects: To create individual instances of classes (e.g., a specific person).
        
        Properties: To describe the properties of the object (e.g., name, phone number).
        
        Methods: To implement the behaviors of the object (e.g., add a new person, search for a person).
        
        Project Description:
        
        1. Design of the main class (Person):
        
        Properties: Name, phone number, email, address.
        
        Methods:
        A constructor to initialize the properties of the object when it is created.
        
        Methods to add, modify, and delete information.
        
        A way to display the person's information in an organized manner.
        
        2. Design of the User Interface (GUI):
        
        Menu options: Add a new person, modify the person's information, delete the person, search for the person, view all the people.
        
        Input fields: To enable the user to enter the information of the new person.
        
        Tables to display data: To display a list of all registered persons.
        
        3. Implementing the main functions:
        
        Adding a new person: A new object of the Person class is created and its properties are filled with the user's data, then it is added to the list of persons.
        
        Editing person information: The person to be modified is searched in the list and its properties are updated with the new data.
        
        Deleting person: The person to be deleted is searched and removed from the list.
        
        Searching for a person: A person can be searched based on his name, phone number or any other property.
        
        Displaying all persons: A list of all registered persons is displayed in a table or an ordered list.
        
        4. Saving data:
        
        Text file: The data can be saved in a simple text file, where each person's information is stored in a separate line.
        
        Database: A database such as SQLite can be used to store data in a more organized and secure way.
        
        Inheritance and class division into grandparent, parent and child were also used as needed.
        
        Other properties such as polymorphism and interface were also used.
        
        Advantages of using object-oriented programming in this project:
        
        Code organization: It helps in organizing the code and makes it more readable and maintainable.
        
        Reusability: The Person class can be reused in other projects that require handling of person information.
        
        Extensibility: New properties and methods can be easily added to the Person class to meet additional requirements.
        
        Possible developments:
        
        Adding more advanced search features: such as searching by keywords or date range.
        
        Exporting data to different formats: such as CSV or Excel.
        
        Creating a more attractive user interface: using libraries such as Swing or JavaFX.
        
        Adding an email sending feature: to send reminders or notifications.
        
        Finally:
        
        The address book project is an excellent project for beginners to learn object-oriented programming concepts in Java. This project can be easily extended to add new features and improve its functionality </p>
