    <h1>SMART DRIVING</h1>
    <p>This project aims to build a model of a remotely controlled car using the Internet, where the ESP32 controller board is used as a microcontroller to control the car's movements and receive them via the Arduino Cloud platform. An OLED screen is also used to display information related to the car's status and a joystick to control its movements manually.

        Components
        Two ESP32 boards: a car board and a control board
        Arduino Cloud: A cloud platform for exchanging data between the two devices in the car remotely.
        OLED screen: To display information such as the car's speed, direction, and battery status.
        Joystick: Manual to control the car's movements.
        Motors: To operate the car's motors.
        Motor driver: To control the speed and direction of the motor.
        Sensors: Such as the obstacle distance sensor.
        Explanation of how it works
        Programming the ESP32 board:
        Each ESP32 board is programmed using the Arduino language.
        The board is programmed to read data from the joystick and from another area, and send this data to the Arduino Cloud platform.
        The board is programmed to receive data from the Arduino Cloud platform to control the motors and update the OLED screen.
        Using Arduino Cloud:
        Two projects are created on the Arduino Cloud platform, one for the car and the other for the controller.
        Each project is connected to its own ESP32 board.
        A simple user interface is created on the Arduino Cloud platform to control the car after it is launched.
        Effort assembly:
        Everything is assembled according to the circuit diagram.
        The transmission is connected to the transmission driver, and the transmission driver to the ESP32 board.
        The OLED display and joystick are connected to the ESP32 board.
        The batteries are connected to the ESP32 power board.
        System testing:
        The system is turned on and the car is controlled remotely using the user interface on the Arduino Cloud platform.
        And checking that all components are working properly and the car is responding to commands.
        To benefit
        Remotely: The car can be controlled from anywhere in the world using the internet.
        Ease of use: The user interface on the Arduino is simple and easy to use.
        Office: Additional features can be added to the project such as cameras or advanced devices.
        The project helps in learning the principles of programming, electronics, etc.
        
        Potential challenges
        
        Communication delay: There may be a delay in the car connection due to poor internet connection.
        
        Secure: Data exchanged between the boards and the Arduino Cloud platform must be protected.
        
        Future Developments
        
        Addition: Camera to display live video from the car.
        
        GPS: Accurately locate the car.
        
        Artificial Intelligence: Use of artificial intelligence techniques to improve the car's performance according to accuracy and reliance on artificial intelligence.
